{"name":"Vokativ","tagline":"PHP class used to convert first names from Serbian language into their vocative case.","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nSerbian language uses vocative case in order to address a person, so when someone register to a site with name Filip it is okay to greet (address) them in English with \"Hello Filip\", but in Serbian it would be \"Zdravo Filipe\", and \"Zdravo Filip\" is not correct and really sounds strange. But vocative is not as simple as appending \"e\" to a name. It has a set of rules and this PHP class tries to apply those rules to all Serbian names. If it can't, it'll use the built-in dictionary (nominative => vocative) to find a correct form.\r\n\r\nNote that it is not perfect and please notify me if you find any erroneously converted names. PRs are also welcome.\r\n\r\n## Intallation\r\n\r\nInstall using composer with:\r\n\r\n`composer require avram/vokativ`\r\n\r\nOr manually by cloning this repository:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/avramovic/Vokativ.git`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    <?php\r\n    require 'vendor/autoload.php';\r\n\r\n    use Avram\\Vokativ\\Vokativ;\r\n    use Avram\\Vokativ\\Dictionary\\VokativIniDictionary;\r\n\r\n    $nominativ = 'Filip';\r\n    $vokativ = new Vokativ(new VokativIniDictionary());\r\n\r\n    header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8');\r\n\r\n    echo \"Vocative case for the \\\"$nominativ\\\" is: \" . $vokativ->make($nominativ) . \" (source: \" . $vokativ->source() . \")\";\r\n\r\nYou should get output like this:\r\n\r\n    Vocative case for the \"Filip\" is: Filipe (source: dictionary)\r\n\r\nInspect the source code to see what methods are available in this class. But usually the `make()` method will be all you need.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
